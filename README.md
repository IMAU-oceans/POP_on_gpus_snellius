# POP_on_gpus_snellius
This project is a cooperation between the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research (IMAU) at Utrecht University and SURFsara in Amsterdam.
It is our goal to improve the performance of ocean model POP by running the most compute intensive kernels on the accelerators (GPUs) of the national supercomputer Snellius.
